# ptt-analyzer
A repository of scripts used to analyze articles posted on PTT


TODO:
- Add module that acts as a main function so that user can specify inputs through CLI more easily
- Add components to perform (rather simplified version of) text mining over the extracted content
  - Taggers, etc.
- Possibility to offload tasks to individual process?
- Add components to visualize the results
