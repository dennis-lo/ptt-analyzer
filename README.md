TODO:
- Add module that acts as a main function so that user can specify inputs through CLI more easily
- Add components to perform (rather simplified version of) text mining over the extracted content
  - Taggers, etc.
- Concurrency
  - Offload I/O tasks to individual workers
- Add components to visualize the results
